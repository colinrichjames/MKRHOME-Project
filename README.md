# MKRHome: AI-Powered DIY Learning Platform

**Bridging the gap between educational technology and hands-on home improvement.**

## 🏠 Project Overview

MKRHome is a comprehensive, AI-powered educational platform designed to empower first-time homeowners—specifically those in their 20s and 30s—to master practical DIY skills. Unlike fragmented or passive resources like YouTube or Pinterest, MKRHome utilizes **project-based learning** and **adaptive feedback** to provide a structured, interactive experience.

The platform is inspired by "Roger," a real-world expert who provided hands-on guidance, and aims to scale that expertise through an AI-driven assistant.

## ✨ Key Features

**AI-Agent "Roger":** A personalized AI assistant powered by OpenAI's ChatGPT that provides real-time, context-aware feedback and troubleshooting as users work through tasks.


* 
**Step-by-Step Project Tutorials:** Highly structured guides that break down complex home improvement tasks into manageable, hands-on steps using text, images, and video.


* 
**Gamification & Engagement:** A system of badges and progress tracking designed to increase user motivation and provide a sense of tangible accomplishment for beginners.


* 
**Centralized Profile Hub:** A personalized "Toolbox" where users manage account details, track completed projects, and catalog their favorite physical tools.


* 
**Mobile-First Accessibility:** Optimized for various screen sizes to allow users to transition seamlessly from a desktop to a garage or garden setting while working.

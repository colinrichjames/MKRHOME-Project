# Project Overview
When you run the index.js file, the homepage of the MKRHome application is launched. On the homepage, you are greeted with a carousel displaying various types of DIY projects you can work on. These images showcase different categories, making it easy for users to get inspired and choose a project.

As you scroll down the page, you’ll find the Featured Projects section, where users can explore specific DIY projects to learn about the skills, steps, and materials required. This section provides links to different types of projects that are available for learning.

A key feature of the application is the Ask Roger functionality.

This feature makes learning DIY easier and more interactive, as Roger provides guidance, answers questions, and gives suggestions tailored to the user’s needs.

For navigation, the top navigation bar allows users to easily explore the site. The profile icon in the top right corner takes users to the Profile Page. On this page, users can view their personal information, including a background image, a list of projects they’ve completed, achievements they’ve earned, and a toolbox section that holds a collection of tools they can use in their DIY projects.
